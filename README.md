# Java Exercises - Module 4 University Assignments

This repository contains solutions to five Java programming exercises from the Module 4 of my university coursework. Each solution is implemented in a separate `.java` file, named according to the question number (e.g., `exercise1.java`, `exercise2.java`, etc.).

## Exercise 1 - Duplicate Removal

Write an application that takes five numbers (ranging from 10 to 100) as input. As each number is entered, the program displays it only if it is not a duplicate of a previously entered number. After each input, show the complete set of unique values entered. This exercise uses a one-dimensional array to handle the problem.

---

## Exercise 2 - Metric Conversions

Write an application that assists users with metric conversions. The application should allow the user to input unit names (e.g., centimeters, liters, grams, etc., for the metric system, and inches, quarts, pounds, etc., for the imperial system) and respond to questions like "How many inches are in 2 meters?" or "How many liters are in 10 quarts?". The program should handle invalid conversions (e.g., "How many inches are in 5kg?" should produce an error).

## Exercise 3 - Morse Code

Write an application that reads a phrase in Portuguese and converts it into Morse code. Additionally, write another application that reads a Morse code phrase and converts it back to Portuguese. Use a space between each Morse-encoded letter and three spaces between words.

---

## Exercise 4 - Prime Numbers and Prime Factors

Write a program that takes an integer input from the user and determines whether it is a prime number. If the number is not prime, the program should display its unique prime factors. For example, for the number 54, the prime factors are 2 and 3 (since 54 = 2 * 3 * 3 * 3).

---

## Exercise 5 - Bubble Sort

Implement the Bubble Sort algorithm, a simple but inefficient sorting technique. This algorithm "bubbles" smaller values to the top of the array (beginning) and larger values to the bottom (end) by repeatedly comparing pairs of adjacent elements and swapping them if necessary. The program should explain why the time complexity of Bubble Sort is O(n²).

## Purpose

This project was developed as part of my university coursework in Java programming. It demonstrates my ability to solve algorithmic problems and apply various programming concepts such as arrays, loops, conditionals, and sorting techniques. It showcases my skills in Java, including implementing algorithms and solving real-world problems.
